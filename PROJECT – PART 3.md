# PROJECT â€“ PART 3

The objective of the third part of the project is to develop the final code of the game that you analized and designed in the first two parts.
You need to update your class, use-case and collaboration diagrams accordingly, and submit a report (with all necessary diagrams) and a code compatible with each other.

You will submit an updated report which includes:  

- Proper title info with a list of group members and the name of the game
- A contents page
- A detailed description of the game
- An updated and expanded version of the class diagram drawn using draw.io
  - Explanation of the classes and relations among them.
  - Do not forget to include relation cardinalities, directions, and roles.
  - You must use Association / Aggregation and Inheritance relations; you can use Composition releation, but it is not necessary.
- Use-case diagram drawn using draw.io
  - Detailed explanation of the use-cases.
- Updated and expanded versions of collaboration diagrams drawn using draw.io. You need to draw _at least one_ diagram for each use-case of your game. You may need additional collaboration diagrams to model polymorphism.
  - Explanation of the diagrams.
  - Do not forget to include proper message parameters and return types.
  - Be careful with your message numbering.

Your code and UML diagrams should match each other in all aspects. You are not expected to write a concise and clear code in an object oriented matter.

Submision check list: Following files are expected to be commited to the git repo.

- Code: at least one `py` file per class and a main py file.
- Report: one `md` file. Put pictures of your UML diagrams drawn in draw.io within the md document.
- drawio files of each UML diagram.

In your report please use good English, and spell-check before you submit. You should include references if you have any.
